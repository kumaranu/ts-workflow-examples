# Usage Guide

This section provides examples of how to use the `ts-workflow-examples` package to perform transition state calculations.

## Running Example Scripts

Navigate to one of the directories that contains example scripts inside the `src/ts-workflow-examples` directory. For example, to run a script from the `geodesic_ts_with_hessian` directory:

```sh
cd src/ts-workflow-examples/geodesic_ts_with_hessian
```

Run the desired script (for example, using_newtonnet.py):
```sh
python using_newtonnet.py
```

Example Scripts

Here are some of the combinations for which you can run the scripts:
    Geodesic TS with Hessian
        Using Mace
        Using NewtonNet
    Geodesic TS without Hessian
        Using Mace
        Using NewtonNet
    NEB TS with Hessian
        Using Mace
        Using NewtonNet
    NEB TS without Hessian
        Using Mace
        Using NewtonNet
